# csharp-template
Use this template to initialize new repositories for C# projects.

1. Create a new repository in GitHub with PROJECT_NAME using this template.
2. Clone that repository to your local machine.
3. Run Visual Studio and create a new Empty Solution with the name PROJECT_NAME. Select the parent folder of the already created PROJECT_NAME folder to create the solution in. This will ensure PROJECT_NAME.sln is put inside the PROJECT_NAME folder.
4. Create a 'src' Solution Folder (and 'tests' Solution Folder) using the Solution Explorer in Visual Studio.
5. Continue as normal, creating Projects as needed, ensuring you create them in the 'src' Solution Folder and, on creation, selecting the PROJECT_NAME/src/ folder as its location.
6. Update this readme file to describe the newly created repository.
