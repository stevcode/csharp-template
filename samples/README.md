# Samples
This folder should contain sample projects that show how to use a library by example.

This readme file exists purely to create the samples/ folder in the git repository. It may be deleted once other files are added to this directory.
Alternatively, if this project is not a library or warrants no sample projects, the folder may also be deleted.
