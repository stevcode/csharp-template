# SRC
Create new Projects as needed, ensuring you create them in the 'src' Solution Folder in the Solution Explorer and, on creation, selecting the PROJECT_NAME/src/ folder as its location. 

This readme file exists purely to create the src/ folder in the git repository. It should be deleted immediately upon creating the initial project.
