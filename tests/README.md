# Tests
Create new test projects as needed, ensuring you create them in the 'tests' Solution Folder in the Solution Explorer and, on creation, selecting the PROJECT_NAME/tests/ folder as its location. 

This readme file exists purely to create the tests/ folder in the git repository. It should be deleted immediately upon creating any test project.
